    <h3>About me</h3>
    <div>
      <p>
        Studied at Nazarbayev University (School of Science and Humanities,
        bachelor of Chemistry), but left the university with an intent to study
        and enter IT sphere. In general, my goal is to work as a software or web
        developer. Programming language is not even that important to me, I just
        like solving programming problems, working with algorithms and code.
